# DEALING WITH TIME DATA BY USING DATETIME MODUL
## Code Purpose: The file named "problem-2.ftr" is a semi-parsed array of dates. Incorrect format data in the file must be converted to correct time formats. The problem itself can be accessed [here](https://github.com/arifegulsah/Fixing-TimeData-ByUsing-DateTime/blob/main/Problem1.png).
